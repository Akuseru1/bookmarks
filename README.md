# installation

`do pipenv install in the root of the project`

the script for running the endpoints needs a user to exist, so do the following:

create a user using `python manage.py createsuperuser`.

then do the following command to run the server:

`python manage.py runserver`


because of time constraints, the script for running the endpoints is not fully functional
so i added a postman file to run the endpoints
